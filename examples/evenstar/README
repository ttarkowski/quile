Evenstar is  an example  program from computational  materials science
domain  and  is  devoted  to crystal  structure  prediction  of  boron
nanowires. It requires additional software and data:

• Boost Graph Library (BGL) — compilation dependency
• Quantum ESPRESSO — runtime dependency
• B.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF pseudopotential — runtime dependency

The program can be compiled with following example command:

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O3 -std=c++20 -pthread -DNDEBUG \
    -I../../ evenstar.cc src/*.cc -DFLAT=true -DCELL_ATOMS=5 \
    -o evenstar

Please  note that  -DFLAT  parameter, describing  whether nanowire  is
flat, can be either true  or false and -DCELL_ATOMS, describing number
of atoms  in nanowire  unit cell,  can be  integer value  greater than
0. The  program can be  executed successfully with  ./evenstar command
only if pseudopotential  file described above is  located in program's
directory. Please note that typical  program run is very long compared
to another examples and requires a lot of computer resources to finish
with meaningful result.  Example program output (with Quantum ESPRESSO
output files excluded) is available in example_output.tar.xz file.
