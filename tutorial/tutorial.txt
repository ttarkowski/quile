Introduction

  Welcome to the Quilë C++ genetic algorithms scientific library!

  This  tutorial  aims  at beginner  library users,   who already know
  basics of  the  genetic  algorithm (GA)  theory.   If you don't know
  foundations of the GA, then you can read about it from the following
  book:

    A. E. Eiben, J. E. Smith.  Introduction  to Evolutionary Computing.
    Second  Edition.  Natural  Computing  Series.  Berlin,  Heidelberg,
    Germany: Springer, 2015. doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8.

  The material of  the book  is  laid  down  in accessible manner  and
  knowledge  from Part I  is much more  than enough to understand this
  tutorial.  Mathematically inclined  readers  who would like to  read
  something short might refer to the following article:

    use of  test  functions.  2022.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03217 .

  1. Installation of the software
  2. Downloading the Quilë library
  3. Example program———Eight queens puzzle

1. Installation of the software

  The following software will be needed:

    * Git revision control system
    * GCC C++ compiler supporting C++20 standard of the language

  It is  assumed,  that reader  has access  to the  personal  computer
  running  GNU/Linux  operating  system  or  has  enough knowledge  to
  translate following instructions  to the specific environment of the
  given operating system software in use.

  To install the software please use your distribution package manager.
  Before installing  any software  please read  your distribution  man
  pages documentation about package manager  (e.g. apt, dnf, pacman or
  zypper  to  name   a  few  package  managers    used   by  different
  distributions).  Please  also  check  if  you have  sudo  priviliges
  (please see sudo man page for details).

  Exercise: Find  and  install  Git  revision control system  and  C++
  # 1.1   : frontend of the GCC compiler.

2. Downloading the Quilë library

  It is assumed here that you have working Git revision control system
  software installed.

  Exercise: Please open the terminal and in your home directory create
  # 2.1   : the ``repos'' directory, if you haven't done it yet:
          :
          : $ cd ~ && mkdir repos

  Tip: The dollar ($) sign at the beginning of the line is not part of
       the command. It indicates the command prompt of the shell.

  Note: It is  assumed  that  you  use  the Bash shell,  which  can be
        checked with following command:

        $ echo ${SHELL}

        If the result is similar to following:
        
        > /bin/bash

        then your shell is indeed the Bash shell.

  Tip: The greater (>) sign  at  the beginning  of  the line  idicates
       command output.

  Exercise: Enter the  ``repos''  directory  and check  that you don't
  # 2.2   : have the directory or file named ``quile'':
          :
          : $ cd repos && ls
          : >
          :
          : If such directory  or  file  does not exist,  then you can
          : clone the newest version of the library:
          :
          : $ git clone https://github.com/ttarkowski/quile.git
          :
          : New directory named ``quile'' should appear after you type
          : ls command again:
          :
          : $ ls
          : > quile

3. Example program———Eight queens puzzle

  It is assumed here  that you have  working  C++ frontend of the  GCC
  compiler installed.

  Exercise: The Quilë library  requires  C++ compiler  supporting  the
  # 3.1   : C++20  standard of  the language.  Please check version of
          : the GCC software by running following command:
          :
          : $ g++ --version
          :
          : If your  g++ compiler version  is older than 10.2.1,  then
          : you  probably  should  consider  upgrading  your GNU/Linux
          : distribution.  See  your  distribution  website  for  more
          : details.

  Note: GCC compiler  version 10.2.1  is enough to follow  the rest of
        the tutorial.

  The eight queens puzzle is well known problem of placing eight chess
  queens on an standard (i.e. 8 x 8) chessboard  so that no two queens
  threaten each other. Here, the problem to solve,  is to generate any
  8 x 8 chessboard configuration satisfying the puzzle.

  Obviously,  no two queens can be placed  on the same row (column) as
  this violates  validity of the solution.  Hence, the problem  can be
  formulated as a some permutation puzzle.

  Let us start with  the view  on the empty 8 x 8 chessboard.  Usually,
  it is shown as in the Fig. 3.1.

  The  usual notation  of placing  pieces  on the chessboard  involves
  letter  from the set {a, ..., h}  followed by a number  from the set
  {1, ..., 9}, e.g. g5.  However,  for the purpose of the puzzle, this
  notation can be adapted———with loss of generality——— as shown in Fig.
  3.2 below.

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+  permutation.  This is example
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Q |  solution  of the eight queens

  This figure demonstrates,  that whole chessboard with 8 queens on it
  can be encoded  into some permutation.  Let us start from the top of
  the figure,  i.e. from the highermost row.  The queen  at highermost
  row  is  put on the column  no. 4  (column numbering  starts from 0).
  The queen at the next row  is at the column no. 0.  Reader might now
  easily see,  that the whole example chessboard can be encoded as the
  following sequence:

    (4, 0, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3)

  which  is   some  permutation   of  (0, ..., 7).   The   permutation
  formulation guarantees  that no two queens threaten each other along
  columns and rows.  However,  the diagonals (in chess meaning)  still
  pose a problem. How it can be solved programmatically?

  The eight queens puzzle can be formulated as an optimization problem.
  One can search for such  permutation (chessboard configuration) that
  minimizes  number of pairs  of queens threatening  each  other.  The
  solution of  the problem  has  number  of such pairs  equal  to zero.
  Fitness  function  can be defined  as  a negated  number of pairs of
  queens threatening  each other (fitness function in GA is maximized):

    f(given chessboard) = - (# of queen pairs threatening each other)

  The  complete  program  can  be  found   in  ``examples/example_2/``
  directory:

  $ less ~/repos/examples/example_2/example_2.cc

  Tip: Please use up and down arrows  to navigate through the document
       and `q` character key to leave ``less'' program.

  Note: There is no mistake. The first example in this tutorial really
        refers to the ``example_2'' from ``examples'' directory of the
        library.

  The source code will  be described  in details later.  At the moment
  it  is worth  to  mention  that  it  uses the swap mutation  and the
  cut-and-crossfill recombination as the variation operators,  fitness
  proportionate selection  with windowing procedure  as the  selection
  probability  function  and  stochastic  universal  sampling  as  the
  selection mechanism.

  Exercise: Compile and run the source code of the eight queens puzzle
  # 3.2   : example.
          :
          : $ cd ~/repos/examples/example_2/
          : $ g++ -std=c++20 -DNDEBUG -O3 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic \
          :     -I/home/${USER}/repos/quile/ -pthread example_2.cc
          : $ ./a.out

  Tip: Long shell commands  can be split into multiple lines  with use
       of '\' character.

  Tip: Shell variable ${USER} is set to the user login string:

       $ echo ${USER}
       > jdoe

  Tip: Default executable name is  a.out.  This can be changed with -o
       option of the compiler:

       $ ls
       > program.cc
       $ g++ program.cc -o program
       $ ls
       > program  program.cc
       $ ./program
       > Hello, world!

  Tip: The exercise  compilation example  uses multiple compiler flags.
       Meaning of each flag can be checked in man page of the compiler.
       Some explanations are also available here:
       
         * -std=c++20 selects C++20 standard of the language.
         * -DNDEBUG disables assertions for faster execution.
         * -O3 optimizes result code for performance.
         * -Wall and -Wextra turn on additional warnings.
         * -pedantic rejects non-standard (cf. -std= flag) behavior.
         * -I/home/${USER}/repos/quile/   includes  Quilë  library  in
            header file search path.
         * -pthread adds support for multithreading.

  Note: The Quilë  library  uses  multithreded  execution  for fitness
        function evaluations.
