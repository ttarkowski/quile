example_1 is a simple evolutionary program  showing genetic drift over
some function.  The program  can be  compiled  with  following example
command:

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O3 -std=c++20 -pthread -DNDEBUG \
    -I../../ example_1.cc -o example_1

The  postprocessing.sh  script  can be invoked  after execution of the
program. It requires additional software:

• gnuplot — postprocessing dependency
